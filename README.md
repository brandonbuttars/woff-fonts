![](woff-fonts)

Common fonts in woff format that are often used on websites and web applications.

## Purpose
When managing different web projects, it's nice to be able to include your webfonts through a `bower package` so you don't have to store the fonts in your repositories. Once this project is indexed by the bower directory, it should be available to install by:

	bower install woff-fonts

## Why woff?
`woff` is currently the most supported format.  When embedding fonts, I've always preferred carrying around as few of font files as possible.  `woff` gives the best browser coverage.

## Project Fonts
* Open Sans
* Roboto

## Why so few fonts?
I'll slowly start adding more fonts.  I am planning on setting up this project with a larger list and this will act as the main repository.  Once the collection gets bigger, I would expect tons of customized forks.

**Feel free to fork the project and customize the list of fonts to only the fonts you need in your project.**
